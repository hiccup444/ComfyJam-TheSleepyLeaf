  - We are nearly ready for Our long nap. Brew Us something worthy of a final waking
    sip.
  - Greetings. This is Our last royal outing before We burrow in. Make it cozy.
  - Ahh, the tea tree. Just what We need before months of very important sleeping.
  - "We\u2019re fattening up for hibernation. Please assist with something warm and
    wonderful."
  - "One more perfect cup, then We vanish into the moss. No pressure\u2026 but also,
