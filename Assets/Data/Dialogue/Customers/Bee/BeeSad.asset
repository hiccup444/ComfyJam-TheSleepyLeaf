  - Oh dear. This is not how We wished to begin Our royal nap.
  - We wanted comfort, not confusion. This will not do for a pre-hibernation treat.
  - "Alas, We shall drift off slightly grumpy. That\u2019s on you, tea-maker."

  - This is no cup to hibernate on. Next time, please try not to ruin the vibe.
